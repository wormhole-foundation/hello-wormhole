The information and materials available through this repo (collectively, “Materials”)
are available on an “AI IS” basis without warranties of any kind, either express or
implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, title, fitness
for a particular purpose and non-infringement. You assume all risks associated with
using the Materials, and digital assets and decentralized systems generally, including
but not limited to, that: (a) digital assets are highly volatile; (b) using digital
assets is inherently risky due to both features of such assets and the potential
unauthorized acts of third parties; (c) you may not have ready access to digital
assets; and (d) there is a risk of losing your digital assets or those owned by a third
party. You agree that you will have no recourse against anyone else for any losses due
to the use of the Materials. For example, these losses may arise from or relate to: (i)
incorrect information; (ii) software or network failures; (iii) corrupted files; (iv)
unauthorized access; (v) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies; or (vi) third-party
activities.

You are solely responsible for using the Materials in compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, including but not limited to, export control or sanctions laws of any
applicable jurisdiction. You should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws
prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting
with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the Specially Designated
Nationals list. Accordingly, you must avoid providing the Materials to sanctioned persons
because such activity could be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law.
